INSERT INTO correspondence_map VALUES ('1','test@blah.com',null,"fish@meh.net",null,"jfpiodsajgoij492139")
cur.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS correspondence_map (count,m_from,mfrom_id,m_to,mto_id,md5_hash)")




every email(md5hashed) needs a unique id so when plotting, we can use that ID to give them a position on the plot x and y plot
this is importent.



either we need to pull every single username, then assign them a unique id and while submitting it to the correspondence_map table, make sure this is included.
	its late so i might have forgotten how the fu'c this shit works
	


basically we need to make a database that looks like this
	The count is the amount of corrospondences they have had.
	The uniqueNumber is locked to the email address, so we can plot based on the location on the graph

0.4	Lexie	7	Sloan	14
(int)count (string)mail_from (int)uniqueNumber (string)mail_to (uniqueNumber)

when the program access a file, it needs to check if the emails exists, if not, add them to a databae, in that database each email must be assigned a unique ID that can define the possition in the graph



CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS correspondence_map (count,from_m,from_uniqueNumber,to_me,to_uniqueNumber)"
