-------------Start
Iv started this darn journal a bit late, but i have finally gotten github to work.
This is just my own Sort of Journal/TODO/wtf/thinkthinkthink and so on list.
Its not perfect and its without a doubt flawed and could need some fixing and what not,
but i hope you understand that it is just for my own sake.




-Things i should cover.
	Github with linux & eclipse (problems, solutions)
		Password, ssh, eclipse config, generation of keys, etc
		
-------------Learning python

	General
		if you add a comma to the end when printing something, it wount do a newline like it does on default.  print "Hej",	
		
		
		
	Global variables
	Functions
	classes
	imports and modules
	Comment problems and irritation
	sqlite (connecting) insert etc etc etc
	loops
	os.listdir
	opening, reading and closing filestreams
	lists
		If a list contains strings, you can combine the string into a single long string using the join string method.
		Sort
			The sort method sorts a list in place. List.sort()
			To get a sorted copy, use the built-in sorted function. out = sorted(L)
		
	email module
		Msg type
		extracting email with email.utils
			regular expressions
	
		
-------------Functionality of the application

graphing
	gnuplot
	Plotting data in a way where it is understandable


database thoughts
	structures
	optimization

Different types of scanners
	Interesting word scanner
		refer to TODO:3. Interesting_word_scanner
	Scanner to remove unwanted mail "Your mailbox has now reached it limit..."
	Scanner to detect massive amounts of similar mails
		not sure how to do this, must store common words and extrapolate high frequency of commen words and flag mails for unwanted scanner
	
Progressbar

Sorting mechanisms for database structure and counting of corrospondance instences
